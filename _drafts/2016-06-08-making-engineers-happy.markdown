title: Making Engineers Happy
---

* Engineers want to make stuff
* Endless bug burn down destroys moral
* Engineers are happy when making stuff is a pleasure
  * When making stuff is a pain in the ass, we lose interest and move on
  * Yes, it's work, but it doesn't have to be a death march
* Want to attract talent? Fuck all those perks.
  * Keep the code base clean and well factored
  * Promote organic learning and self-improvement
  * Recognize personal development in technique
  * Make development a pleasure (or at least less sucky than the alternative)
