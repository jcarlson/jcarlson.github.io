title: My Love and Hate for John Gruber
---

I'll set the record straight before I get too far into this rant: I have the utmost respect for John Gruber and what he's created at Daring Fireball.

I listen to Gruber's podcast, The Talk Show, on a fairly regular basis, and it's often the source of interesting new ideas or insights from the tech industry that I, in turn, discuss with friends and family.

And I must concede, I posses nowhere near the credibility that Gruber garners from his decades in the industry. I am downright jealous, in fact, that Gruber pulls off blogging about technology as a full time gig.

But Mr. Gruber, seriously, the Talk Show needs to change.

[Mostly] weekly installments of two-plus hours is a bit difficult to slog through on a regular basis.

The endless off-topic banter is exacerbated by the often ill-prepared knowledge of the topic at hand. This isn't just some fanboy technicality correcting errata in the show notes. It's the nonchalant attitude of indifference for what's his name or that other product that you know which company makes, I think.
