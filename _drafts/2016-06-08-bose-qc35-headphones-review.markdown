title: Review: Bose QC35 Bluetooth Headphones
---

Bose makes some impressive audio technology. I've owned a few of their products over the years, including the QC3 headphones, Companion 5 computer speakers and SoundLink Mini portable speaker. I've always been impressed.

I've always been a bit of an audiophile, and in the last 18 months, my particularly discerning ears have focused their attention on headphones. I just can't find the perfect pair.

My collection now includes Sony's legendary MDR-7506 studio monitors, Audio Technica's ultra-crisp MSR-7 cans, Sennheiser's warm and luscious HD598 open-backed and Momentum over-ear models, a pair of Turtle Beach Earforce Stealth 450 gaming headsets, and a pair of BlueAnt Pump sport ear buds. The list of headphones I've tried and retired over the years goes on even longer.

Why so many headphones, you might ask? Well, just as no one tool in the toolbox can do all the jobs equally well, neither can one pair of headphones satisfy every listening (or speaking) task.

As a software developer often on the go, remote collaboration with colleagues is a must and this often includes long Skype sessions. Most of my headphones are thus divided into two buckets: those that work well with VoIP applications, and those that are strictly for listening.

Most headphones tout some level of noise cancelling or isolation, be it active (as is the case with the Bose QC35), or passive (with thick, insulating padding around the ear cup). Either mechanism is designed to block out all sound, except that which you're listening to. This includes the sound of your own voice. And this presents a problem for VoIP applications; you can't hear yourself. Try placing your palms over your ears and having a conversation with yourself.

To speak comfortably for any length of time, you need to hear yourself, either through in-ear monitoring, or with open-backed headsets; The latter eschews noise isolation and allows the surrounding environment to mix freely with the audio source. The plus side is that you can hear yourself and your surroundings; the downside is your surroundings can hear whatever you're listening to, so you might want to rethink that Best of Brittany playlist you've been curating for in-office listening.

But I digress.
