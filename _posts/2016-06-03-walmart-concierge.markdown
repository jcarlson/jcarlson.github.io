title: Walmart the Concierge Service?
---

> Walmart and Sam’s Club will begin testing last-mile grocery delivery that uses services including Uber, Lyft and Deliv, to bring customers’ orders to their homes. The announcement is being made at Walmart’s annual shareholders week in Arkansas, and comes following the launch of a similar pilot program in Miami in March. There, Walmart-owned Sam’s Club is using the parcel delivery service Deliv to test delivery of general merchandise and groceries for its business members in the area.

This will be something interesting to follow. When I hear someone mention "WalMart", about the last two thing I would think of are "concierge" and "service". WalMart customers in particular don't strike me as the kind of clientele who would be interested in "value added" services, like home delivery, that increase costs. That is unless WalMart plans to somehow include the cost of delivery in the products themselves, slashing bottom line prices elsewhere...
