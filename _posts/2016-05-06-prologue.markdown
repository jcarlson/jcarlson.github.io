Five years ago I started a blog on WordPress and called it Living5to9.com. I really liked the premise of that blog; I wrote about all the things that kept me busy outside of work. It didn't take long for other priorities to get in the way and the blog to become abandoned, though. Shame.

I'm taking another stab at the idea, now. I've worked on a lot of projects since 2011, and I think it's well past time for me to start building a professional portfolio of my work.

Since this incarnation of my blog is intended to be more "professional", I'll keep this prologue short and sweet, and dispatch quickly with the wishy washy stuff. But before I do, thanks for stopping by and having a look at my blog! I hope you enjoy it!
